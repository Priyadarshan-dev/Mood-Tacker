## 🧠 Project Logic

- *Authentication*: Firebase Auth is used to register/login users.
- *Mood Entry*: Each user can select one emoji and add a mood note per day.
- *Firestore Storage*: Data is stored in:
  
  users/{uid}/moods/{auto-id}
  
- *Security*: Firestore rules ensure users only access their own data.
- *State Management*: Provider is used to manage mood entries in real-time.
